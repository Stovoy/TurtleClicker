TurtleClicker
=============

Short little script I wrote for automating http://www.koanoftheday.com/shells/

Note: This is not to be used to game the charity work done by the creator of the software!
This was simply created to see how easily a program would be able to do this task. The answer? Very easily.

I wrote it in AutoHotkey because it has image search, screen access, and mouse output built in. To use it, simply install AHK, have both those files on your computer, and run the script. Start it by pressing Alt+S, and left click on the top left region of the game, then left click on the bottom right region of the game, as the tooltips indicate. The script will then click on any turtles found. The game window has to be in the standard size for it to work. To stop it, just press Alt+S again.
